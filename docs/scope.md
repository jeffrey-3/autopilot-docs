# Scope

I am writing down the scope of the project because it helps me make decisions and save time. 
- Throughout the project I have found myself adding features that turns out I didn't need, and then deleting them later which wastes time. 
- I also don't need to worry about adding more features by limiting the scope.
- Additionally, I have found myself spending hours on the fence between two ways to solve a problem that both work, but I don't know which one I should choose. The solution is to refer back to the scope and requirements list.
